# DS440-HonorsOption

This repository is the code that I used for my honoes option in DS 440 Capstone

Consulting Script contains the code I adapted and wrote to create an elastic search engine on my local system
I prepared this code and gave it to Team 2. I also demonstrated it to them

NBA_Stats.csv is the dataset that I used to demonstrate the search engine

search.js is an example I found that uses the method fetch from npm node-fetch to call the API with queries from the search engine

test3.py is the python script that I wrote and partially adapted to send a csv file to the index of the elasticsearch search engine

e3.py is another python script I created that sends data - it was unused because I switched to using the library elasticsearch-loader
